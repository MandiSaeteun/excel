      <p class="sub-header textleft">Interpreting is the unrehearsed conversion of a spoken or signed message from one language to another. It involves listening to a message in one language and then providing an oral or signed equivalent into another language. Interpreters must have excellent knowledge of both source and target languages, possess strong mental dexterity and exceptional memory. Court, medical and community interpreters work in both direction; some conference and UN interpreters only interpret in one direction.</p>

        <li class="accordion-item is-active" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">1. What mode of interpretation do you require?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Simultaneous or Consecutive? The skills sets for simultaneous and consecutive are quite different, and not all interpreters have equal capabilities. While simultaneous interpreting can reduce the meeting time by half the speed, it may not be the most effective communication style for your clients. Understanding the difference can save time, money and determine how smooth the meeting will run for you and your clients.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">2. How do I know whether I need a licensed; certified foreign language interpreter?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>First, there are many levels of certification in the language industry. While contracting with an LSP can make things easier, the caveat is being able to hire a certified interpreter who is in fact licensed by notable industry entities, as opposed to hiring an “agency certified” interpreter. The difference here is not just pricing; often it’s quality.</p>
            <p>You can ensure that your linguists have had their language proficiency skills assessed by asking for the interpreter’s name and cross referencing it with agencies that assessed their skill sets. You want to know the difference between a linguist that is “certified” by the language service provider (LSP) they are working for or certified by well recognized entities.</p>
            <p>Currently, the law requires the use of licensed interpreters for most legal and medical interpreting assignments. While hiring a certified interpreter is ideal in every situation; it is not always practical. It may be cost prohibitive or there may not be an interpreter available altogether. Choosing the appropriate level of certification will depend on the individual job or the requesting party. If you are not sure what you are doing, working with a respected; transparent language service provider can make a huge difference because a skilled LSP will ask the right questions and guide you and your clients to successful outcomes.</p>
            <p>The following are common, well recognized entities that “certify” interpreters and translators:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>California Judicial Council Court Certified and Court Registered legal interpreters</li>
              <li>Federally Certified Interpreters</li>
              <li>California State Personnel Board (Administrative and Medical) licensed interpreters</li>
              <li>Certified Medical Interpreters (CMI)</li>
              <li>The American Translators Association (ATA) -the only agency that gauges translation skills</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">3. What is the difference between interpretation and translation?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>A translator converts the written text of one language into the text of the target language. An interpreter verbally converts the meaning of one spoken (source) language into the spoken (target) language of another. Simply said, interpreters speak and translators write. Each requires a distinct set of skills and aptitudes as well as mental dexterity and memory. Not everyone has equal capabilities. While some can translate and interpret, most can perform one but not both tasks. Even a smaller percentage of interpreters and translators can interpret, translate and sight translate.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">4. How do I know the interpreter I am getting is certified?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Interpreter certification can be critical and it can influence outcomes. If your case requires the use of a Court Certified or a Court Registered Interpreter, and you know what you are doing, you can search for someone and hire directly; on your own, from the appropriate state interpreter registry. If you choose to hire through a language service provider (LSP), make sure you ask for the interpreter’s name and cross reference the interpreter with corresponding California interpreter registries to ensure they are in fact licensed by the state (and not “certified” by a language company). The quality is not the same. Avoid compromising the integrity of your case by knowing the difference.</p>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">5. What is the cost of interpretation services?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Factors that influence interpreter fees include certification levels required for the job, language, availability of interpreters, duration of the job, nature of the interpretation, mileage, travel time and/or lodging. Depending on the level of certification, there is usually a two hour to a half-day, industry practice, minimum requirement. Scheduling interpreter services in advance will help keep costs to a minimum.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">6. Why you should book interpreter services in advance?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Advance scheduling, with as much advance notice as possible, will ensure local interpreters are hired and this will help obviate costs related to mileage, travel time and possible lodging. If you are seeking to hire licensed certified interpreters from the state of California, know there are only so many for each language pair, within a specific region of the state. Avoid running the risk of interpreter unavailability by booking someone in advance.</p>
