      <p class="sub-header textleft">Founded by a Registered Court Interpreter, Koy Saephan, who came to this country as a refugee, the mission of Excel is to help clients working with limited English proficient individuals and families to overcome language barriers, and to connect with them effectively, through the assistance of culturally aware and linguistically qualified interpreters and translators.</p>

      <p class="sub-header textleft nobottom-space">Koyâ€™s professional interpreting career began in 1999 when she became the first Court Interpreter in the Iu-Mien language. The Iu-Mien people in the U.S. are from Laos; with a population of fewer than 50,000 in the U.S. She received her B.A. in Literature from UCLA in 1996, worked in education for a few years and studied law for over two years.  As a seasoned interpreter with a wide range of experience, Koy believes she can make broader impact in the community through her work in the language industry. After ten years as a full time employee for California Courts, Koy decided to launch Excel Interpreting Interpreting &amp; Translating in 2010.  Since her early college years, Koy has made civic engagement and community work an important part of her journey. For the last nine years, Koy has been a board member for <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.lfcd.org/" target="_blank">Lao Family Community Development, Inc.</a>, a non-profit with offices in San Pablo, Oakland and Sacramento.</p>
