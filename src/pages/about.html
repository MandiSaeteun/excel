      <p class="sub-header textleft">Founded by a Registered Court Interpreter, Koy Saephan, who came to this country as a refugee, the mission of Excel is to help clients working with limited English proficient individuals and families to overcome language barriers, and to connect with them effectively; through the assistance of culturally aware and linguistically qualified interpreters and translators.</p>
      <img class="intro-image" src="/assets/img/team-photo.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="sub-header textleft">Koyâ€™s professional interpreting career began in 1999 when she became the first Court Interpreter in the Iu-Mien language. She received her B.A. in Literature from UCLA in 1996, worked in education for a few years, studied law for over two years and worked for ten years as a full time employee for California Courts before launching Excel Interpreting Interpreting &amp; Translating in 2010. As a seasoned interpreter with wide ranging experience, Koy believes she can make broader impact in the community through her work in the language industry.</p>
